This is some text.[^1]. Other text.[^footnote].

Here's a thing[^other-note].

And another thing[^codeblock-note].

This one doesn't even match[^nope].


[^1]: Some *bolded* footnote definition.

[^footnote]:
    > Blockquotes can be in a footnote.

        as well as code blocks

    or, naturally, simple paragraphs.

[^other-note]:       no code block here (spaces are stripped away)

Not a footnote!

[^codeblock-note]:
        this is now a code block (8 spaces indentation)
